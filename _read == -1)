       read — read from standard input into shell variables

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _r_e_a_d utility shall read a single logical line from standard input into one or more shell variables.

       By  default,  unless the --rr option is specified, <backslash> shall act as an escape character. An unescaped <backslash> shall preserve the literal value of the following character, with the exception of a <newline>.  If a <newline> follows the <backslash>, the _r_e_a_d utility
       shall interpret this as line continuation. The <backslash> and <newline> shall be removed before splitting the input into fields. All other unescaped <backslash> characters shall be removed after splitting the input into fields.

       If standard input is a terminal device and the invoking shell is interactive, _r_e_a_d shall prompt for a continuation line when it reads an input line ending with a <backslash> <newline>, unless the --rr option is specified.

       The terminating <newline> (if any) shall be removed from the input and the results shall be split into fields as in the shell for the results of parameter expansion (see _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _2_._6_._5, _F_i_e_l_d _S_p_l_i_t_t_i_n_g); the first field shall be assigned to the first variable _v_a_r, the  sec‐
       ond field to the second variable _v_a_r, and so on. If there are fewer fields than there are _v_a_r operands, the remaining _v_a_rs shall be set to empty strings. If there are fewer _v_a_rs than fields, the last _v_a_r shall be set to a value comprising the following elements:

        *  The field that corresponds to the last _v_a_r in the normal assignment sequence described above

        *  The delimiter(s) that follow the field corresponding to the last _v_a_r

        *  The remaining fields and their delimiters, with trailing _I_F_S white space ignored

       The setting of variables specified by the _v_a_r operands shall affect the current shell execution environment; see _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _2_._1_2, _S_h_e_l_l _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.  If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it shall not affect the shell variables in the caller's environment.

       The _r_e_a_d utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _1_2_._2, _U_t_i_l_i_t_y _S_y_n_t_a_x _G_u_i_d_e_l_i_n_e_s.

       The following option is supported:

       --rr        Do not treat a <backslash> character in any special way. Consider each <backslash> to be part of the input line.

       _L_A_N_G      Provide  a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _8_._2, _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values
                 of locale categories.)

       _L_C___A_L_L    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       _L_C___C_T_Y_P_E  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       _N_L_S_P_A_T_H   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S.

       _P_S_2       Provide the prompt string that an interactive shell shall write to standard error when a line ending with a <backslash> <newline> is read and the --rr option was not specified.

       The --rr option is included to enable _r_e_a_d to subsume the purpose of the _l_i_n_e utility, which is not included in POSIX.1‐2008.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The following command:

           while read -r xx yy
           do
               printf "%s %s\n$yy$xx"
           done < _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e

       prints a file with the first field of each line moved to the end of the line.

RRAATTIIOONNAALLEE
       The _r_e_a_d utility historically has been a shell built-in. It was separated off into its own utility to take advantage of the richer description of functionality introduced by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Since _r_e_a_d affects the current shell execution environment, it is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it does not affect the shell variables in the environment of the caller.

       Although the standard input is required to be a text file, and therefore will always end with a <newline> (unless it is an empty file), the processing of continuation lines when the --rr option is not used can result in the input not ending with a <newline>.  This occurs  if
       the  last line of the input file ends with a <backslash> <newline>.  It is for this reason that ``if any'' is used in ``The terminating <newline> (if any) shall be removed from the input'' in the description.  It is not a relaxation of the requirement for standard input to
       be a text file.
